Work in process POW weekend project blockchain

1) Start the Mining Nodes using the script or manually (node index <port>)
- currently, we start with port 4000 and increment by 1, peer notification
  algorithm likely needs some work to get more robust.

2) start a client with: npx parcel index.html (building off Proj1) 
- Currently this client only talks to port 4000

TODO: We need to print Pub/Priv keys for each node/miner to make it easier
